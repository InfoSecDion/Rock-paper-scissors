In this project, we will explore how to identify basic file IoCs, create YARA rules for detecting malicious activity, and utilize tools such as yarGen and Arya for rule generation and testing. These skills are invaluable for threat detection and mitigation in various cybersecurity roles.
Yara
YARA is an open-source malware classification tool used to identify and classify malware or suspicious files based on its signatures or rules. It is a powerful and flexible tool that allows users to create rules matching their organizationâ€™s needs or targeting specific threats. It serves as a crucial component for cybersecurity professionals to effectively mitigate and detect threats.
